# Quick steps to get started

## Starting a new session

1.  Start a new session from the backlog context menu or use the _Estimate_ hub and select an iteration
2.  Share the generated link with your team members, so that they are able to join
3.  Once all members have joined, everyone picks a card
4.  After everyone has picked a card, click `Reveal` to reveal everyone's estimate
5.  Select and commit the final estimate
6.  Move on to the next work item. Estimates are automatically saved to the work items.

After you are done, you can end the session.

## Joining an existing session

There are two ways to join an existing session, use a direct link, or pick an existing session from the _Estimate_ hub
